\noindent \emph{An ambitious and curious student who is currently finishing his Master's degree in Language Technology.}
\\
I have since picking up Chinese been having a great interest in language no matter what area. When the academic language studies concluded in Shanghai 2011, I naturally chose to continue within the area of computational linguistics, which has been the main topic of studies for these past four years.

I wrote my Bachelor's thesis on using compositions of distributional semantic vectors in sentiment classification. Next semester, for my Master's thesis, I intend to continue to work on distributed representations.

    concerned being responsible for technical support, where I was an essential part in building a support process which assured that customers' technical inquiry were dealt with in a transparent and efficient manner.
    
I curated and constructed targets of interest in various languages and key domains for business intelligence use. I have also developed several internal tools for data analysis, with work in web development, general programming and various natural language processing areas such as automatic sentiment analysis evaluation, Chinese word segmentation, tokenization and transliteration.}}

    {\bodytext{For some language pairs, pronoun translation is a discourse-driven task which requires information that lies beyond its local context. This motivates the task of predicting the correct pronoun given a source sentence and a target translation, where the translated pronouns have been replaced with placeholders. For cross-lingual pronoun prediction, we suggest a neural network-based model using preceding nouns and determiners as features for suggesting antecedent candidates. Our model scores on par with similar models while having a simpler architecture.}}}
