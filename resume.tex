\noindent \emph{An ambitious and curious student who just wrapped up his Master's degree in Language Technology and is currently working as a language engineering contractor for Apple in California.}
\\
After concluding my Chinese studies I looked for ways to combine my love for language learning with my interests in computer science, and found a small academic program called language technology. As I started learning about natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, so did the world. I am now look for opportunities to apply my skills within these areas in a real-world setting.

My \href{http://stp.lingfil.uu.se/exarb/master/callin2017.pdf}{Master's thesis} focused on evaluating various word embeddings and machine learning models for use in shallow discourse parsing. Please see my Github page for a portfolio of code projects: \href{https://github.com/jimmycallin}{github.com/jimmycallin}

Despite my limited time I quickly became an integrated part of the team and took on responsibilities usually reserved for full-time employees. After finishing my Master's thesis I returned for another four months of work.}}

My day-to-day work concerned being responsible for technical support, where I was an essential part in building a support process which assured that customers' technical inquiry were dealt with in a transparent and efficient manner.

I curated and constructed targets of interest in various languages and key domains for business intelligence use. I have also developed several internal tools for data analysis, with work in web development, general programming and various natural language processing areas such as automatic sentiment analysis evaluation, Chinese word segmentation, tokenization and transliteration.}}

For cross-lingual pronoun prediction, we suggest a neural network-based model using preceding nouns and determiners as features for suggesting antecedent candidates. Our model scores on par with similar models while having a simpler architecture.}}}
